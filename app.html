        I guess I'll turn in. Cool. Dad? I feel like I've spent my life pretending you're a great guy and trying to be like you.
 And the ugly truth has always been -- That I'm not that great a guy and you're exactly like me.
 Am I evil? Worse.
 You're smart.
 When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours.
 And I've never met a universe that was into it.
 The universe is basically an animal.
 It grazes on the ordinary.
 It creates infinite idiots just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy.
 Tommy.
 Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie.
 You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but it'll never stop trying to throw you.
 And, eventually, it will.
 There's no other way off.
 Dad, I'm out of excuses to not be who I am.
 So who am I? What do I do? My advice -- Take off.
 Put a saddle on your universe.
 Let it kick itself out.
 I can't do that.
 The kids, Jerry, my job, and, as much as I hate to admit it, ABC's "The Bachelor.
 " I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you, with all your memories.
 An exact copy in every way.
 It'll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic
 level as you.
 You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences.
 The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clone's job is done.
 It feels no pain, it regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going "Blade Runner.
 " If nothing matters, why would you do that for me? I don't know, maybe you matter so little that I like you.
 Or maybe it makes you matter.
 Maybe I love you.
 Maybe something about your mother.
 Don't jump a gift shark in the mouth.
 I don't know if I can do it.
 Then stay, and luxuriate in a life you can finally know you've chosen.
 My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose, you're finally gonna chill the fuck
 out.
 Okay.
 I know what I want to do.
